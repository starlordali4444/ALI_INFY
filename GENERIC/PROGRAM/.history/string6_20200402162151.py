'''
Given a string containing uppercase characters (A-Z), compress the string using Run Length encoding. Repetition of character has to be replaced by storing the length of that run.

Write a python function which performs the run length encoding for a given String and returns the run length encoded String.

def encode(message):
    pass
    #Remove pass and write your logic here

#Provide different values for message and test your program
encoded_message=encode("ABBBBCCCCCCCCAB")
print(encoded_message)
