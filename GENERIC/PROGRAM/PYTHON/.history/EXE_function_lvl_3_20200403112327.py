'''Write a Python function to find all the Strong numbers in a given list of numbers.
Write another function to find and return the factorial of a number. Use it to solve the problem.

Example:
A number is considered to be a Strong number if sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to the number itself. 
145 is a Strong number as 1! + 4! + 5! = 145. 

Sample Input

num_list = [145,375,0,100,2]

Expected Output

[145, 2]

 

Note: 0!=1

def factorial(number):
    if number==1:
        return number
    else:
        rfactorial(number-1)


def find_strong_numbers(num_list):
    pass #remove pass and write your logic to find and return the list of strong numbers from the given list


num_list=[145,375,100,2,10]
strong_num_list=find_strong_numbers(num_list)
